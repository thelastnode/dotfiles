* Disable menu bars
We don't need any of the default menu bars, so let's disable those.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(menu-bar-mode 0)
(tool-bar-mode 0)
(scroll-bar-mode 0)
#+end_src

* Change backup behavior
Creating a =foo.bar~= or =#foo.bar#= files everywhere is messy. Let's
put them all in one place: =~/.emacs.d/backups=.

As for the actual backups, backup by copying instead of moving (so
symlinks aren't clobbered), use version control, keep 6 new versions
and 2 old versions, and silently delete unnecessary backups.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups"))
      backup-by-copying t
      delete-old-versions t
      kept-new-versions 6
      kept-old-versions 2
      version-control t)
#+end_src

* Whitespace
** Don't mix tabs and spaces
Why would anyone do this?

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)
#+end_src

** Autoindent after newline
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)
#+end_src

* Column number
Show column numbers.
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(column-number-mode 1)
#+end_src

* Evil mode
Because vim is an excellent text editor.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/vendor/evil")
(require 'evil)
#+end_src
